"""Runtime scorer — how fast the PRODUCED PROGRAM is, per language.

WHY NOT JUST PARSE THE TEST SUITE'S OWN TIMING. Nearly every framework prints a
duration (`ℹ duration_ms 61.3`, `Finished in 0.033 seconds`, `Time Elapsed
00:00:00.36`, …), and scraping those is a morning's work. It would measure the
wrong thing. A suite's wall time is dominated by process start-up, framework
overhead, and **how many tests the model decided to write** — on the identical
bookshop task Fable 5 wrote 6 tests and Opus 5 wrote 104, a ~17x spread with the
language held constant. Model-authored tests also exercise different work, so
even "the slowest single test" is not the same operation across two runs.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. Run a **fixed, retort-authored probe** against the
finished artifact: the same operation, the same input, every implementation,
every language. That is the only way the number means "how fast is this program"
rather than "how verbose were its tests".

The probe per task is the task's own uniform contract:

  rest-api-crud  — start the server, then N identical HTTP round-trips
                   (POST /books + GET /books) against it.
  brazil-bench   — start the MCP server on stdio, then N identical
                   `tools/call` round-trips. Its cold start is also a real
                   measurement: every implementation loads the SAME six CSVs
                   (23,954 matches), so load time is directly comparable in a
                   way a test suite never is.
  cli-data-pipeline — pipe the SAME CSV through the same filter/sort/aggregate.

CONFOUNDERS THIS CONTROLS FOR, because otherwise the numbers are noise:

  * **JIT warm-up** — Java and C# are slow for the first iterations and then
    fast. WARMUP_ITERS are run and discarded, and the reported figure is the
    MEDIAN of the timed iterations, not the mean, so one stall does not set it.
  * **Cold start vs steady state** — reported separately. For a CLI tool the
    cold start IS the user experience; for a server it is a one-off. Collapsing
    them into one number would flatter servers and punish CLIs.
  * **Build time** — excluded. A compiled language must not be charged for
    `cargo build` in a latency figure. Build cost is `_duration_seconds`.
  * **A busy machine** — this measures wall clock, so a concurrent experiment
    corrupts it silently. `measure()` refuses to run while a `retort run` is
    alive rather than returning a plausible wrong number.

The score is a normalized 0..1 (fast → 1.0) so ANOVA can use it, but the raw
milliseconds are the point and are returned by `measure()` for the report.

#: (the TypeScript one validates with zod) rejects the handshake without them,
#: and an earlier version of this probe omitted both and read the resulting
#: -32603 as "the server never answered".
#:
#: The second call is `tools/list`, NOT a named tool. Tool NAMES are chosen by
#: each implementation and are not pinned by the spec, so `tools/call` with a
#: fixed name would silently measure "did this run happen to pick that name"
#: rather than "how fast is this program". `tools/list` is protocol-guaranteed,
#: so it is the same request everywhere — and because these servers load all six
#: CSVs at start-up, the round-trip still includes the data load that makes the
#: number interesting.
#: The `notifications/initialized` line is REQUIRED, not decorative. The MCP
#: lifecycle is initialize -> initialized -> normal traffic, and a spec-faithful
#: server will not serve `tools/list` until it has seen the notification. Omitting
#: it made those servers sit silent, which the probe reported as "did not answer"
#: — the failure looked identical to a broken program.
