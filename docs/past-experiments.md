# Past experiments — completed runs & rejected candidates

Append-only log of finished work, in **increasing experiment order**. Each entry is the
**result** (the pre-registration plan lived in [`future-experiments.md`](future-experiments.md)
before launch and is removed from the queue once the run lands). Rejected / parked model
candidates are recorded at the end. The live queue of what to do next is in
[`future-experiments.md`](future-experiments.md).

Local-model work runs on a **MacBook Pro M5, 64 GB** (GPU wired limit ~56 GB), serving MLX
models via **oMLX** and driving them with the **Hermes** agent (+ `hermes-lcm` context engine).

## Completed experiments

### exp-16–20, 22, 23 — the early local exploration
Full per-cell results are under each `experiments/**/RESULTS.md`. Key findings: **exp-16**
(Qwen3-Coder-30B via llama.cpp) — context is the first-order lever (0.08 @32K → 0.33 @128K).
**exp-17** — the Hermes agent vs `omp`. **exp-18** — Hermes-lcm + Qwen3.6-35B cracked TypeScript
(0.38, the best local result at the time). **exp-19** — prompt factor on the 35B (ATDD worst,
0/3). **exp-20** — 35B × 9 languages (niche-language wall). **exp-22** — 80B first-try 0.33 < 35B
0.50 ("bigger isn't better", later shown to be a compaction artifact — see exp-34/38). **exp-23**
— Devstral via llama.cpp, 0.17 (wrong harness). ⚠️ **All exp-17→27 Hermes runs are understated
floors**, not measurements — they ran through the temp=1.0 and write-refusal bugs (see *Harness
bugs* below); the exp-28+ re-baseline supersedes them.

### exp-21 — self-repair with evaluation feedback (35B)
Gave exp-20's near-miss failures a second try, seeded with their own code + the evaluation
feedback. **Repair roughly doubled pass-proportion 0.11 → 0.22, but only on mainstream
languages** — the niche-language wall held (a true capability ceiling, not something feedback
rescues). Scoring rule (still in force): a repaired pass counts **half credit** toward
pass-proportion (it needed the eval handed to it), while all quality metrics stay at their true
final values. This is the same mechanism as the default inline second-chance now baked into
every run; the self-repair *method* is reused by the queued exp-41 (iteration-2 on the 80B).

### exp-24 — KV prefix cache (resolved: no help)
Turned oMLX's on-disk prefix cache on and re-ran the identical 80B grid
([RESULTS](../experiments/adrianco/experiment-24-qwennext80b-cached/RESULTS.md)). Pass-proportion
**0.33 → 0.33**; the cache *hits* (88K prefix restored in ~2.5 s vs ~150 s cold) but our runs are
**generation-bound, not prefill-bound**, so faster prefill doesn't convert to reliability. Leave
the cache on for free prefill latency, but expect nothing from it. (Operationally: keep the
paged-SSD cache **small** — a 120 GB cap silently fills the disk; 5 GB is plenty.)

### exp-25/26 — the hard task on the local 35B (resolved)
**exp-25:** the 35B copes with brazil-bench in Python (1/3 clean MCP server, req_cov 1.0), not Go
(0/3); overall 0.17, half the runs hit the 30-min wall (generation-bound). **exp-26:** doubling
the timeout to 60 min lifted pass 0.17 → 0.33, crashes 3 → 1, and Go went from all-zeros to a
0.92-req-coverage near-miss. The wall was masking capability; the residual gap is now capability
(Go's last mile), not budget. **Next speed lever is throughput (MTP), not more wall-clock.**

### exp-27 — sampling fractional factorial (35B) — the sampling tier of issue #40
Res IV 2^(4-1), 8 presets over temperature/top_p/top_k/repetition_penalty
([RESULTS](../experiments/adrianco/experiment-27-sampling-ff/RESULTS.md)). Overall **0.83
pass-proportion vs ~0.45 at the old temp=1.0 default.** Main effects: **repetition_penalty 1.1 is
harmful** (−0.25 pass, owns all 4 stall-crashes); top_p 0.95 > 0.85 (+0.17); top_k 20 slightly >
off; **temperature 0.2 ≈ 0.7 (zero effect — the win is getting OFF 1.0, not the precise value).**
Best config ≈ Qwen's own rec (temp ~0.6, top_p 0.95, top_k 20, no rep penalty). `min_p` dropped
(oMLX strips it). This established the correct local sampling now baked into optimal-blog's
forbidden settings, and revealed that every prior local number was understated.

### exp-28 — the local re-baseline (35B arm)
At correct sampling (temp 0.6, top_p 0.95, top_k 20, no rep penalty) and a **true 256K context**,
the 35B on bookshop mainstream: **python 3/3, go 3/3** (both were ~0.5–0.67 at the broken temp=1.0
stack — the old numbers badly understated); typescript 0/3 ("tests did not run"); rust 0/2
(thrash/near-miss). The 35B is the production local stack for **Python/Go** (0.85 each across
later aggregation). See *Harness bugs & the re-baseline saga* below for why this re-baseline was
necessary and what it invalidated.

### exp-29 — the 80B re-baseline (Qwen3-Coder-Next)
n=3/language: **python 1.00 (beats 35B), go 0.67 (rep2 stalled to the wall), typescript 0.33.**
`retort diagnose` classified the non-completions GENUINE. Doubling the model helps Python but not
Go/TS, and it's ~2× slower. Recorded the model correctly via the `stack_metadata()` fix (no slug
guessing). Verdict at the time: a candidate, not yet recommended.

### exp-30 — more 80B reps on Python/Go
exp-29+30 combined, n=9/language: **python 9/9 = 1.00** (best local Python), **go 6/9 = 0.67** —
the Go stall recurred (2 runs stalled to the 25-min wall, both GENUINE non-termination). Split
recommendation at the time: 80B for Python, 35B for Go. Two harness bugs fixed here: the live
monitor now descends through launcher wrappers; the tool-refusal abort is gated on `wrote_nothing`
so Hermes's benign "N files NOT modified" advisory no longer discards good runs.

### exp-31 — the 80B on the HARD task (brazil)
n=6: **0.00 pass (0/6)** but **mean requirement_coverage 0.83** — the 80B consistently gets ~10/12
capabilities, never all 12. The 35B is 0.25 (3/12), mean 0.79 — lower average but occasionally
nails all 12. `reevaluate --force` re-confirmed every near-miss as genuine. **Local models don't
reliably clear hard tasks (0–25%); hard stays a cloud niche** (Fable 5 = 1.00). The Go stall
recurred here too (task-independent).

### exp-32 — prompt-factor re-test on the 80B
python routine, n=3/prompt: the prompt is a **flat line on the 80B** — neutral/BDD/TDD/**ATDD all
1.00.** Contrast the 35B (exp-19): neutral/BDD 0.67, TDD 0.33, ATDD 0.00. **The methodology lever
bites in proportion to model weakness** — "never ATDD locally" was 35B-specific. General rule now
in the guide: reach for a disciplined methodology only near a model's capability edge, else pick
neutral (cheapest).

### exp-33 — TypeScript on the 80B (at the 0.35 default)
n=6 (combined with exp-29 → n=9): **TS = 0.33 (3/9)** — 2 passes, 1 near-miss, 2 genuine fails,
**1 stall.** Confirmed TS-on-80B unreliable at the default threshold, and — the cross-cutting
finding — the **intermittent stall is NOT Go-specific** (it hangs on TS too). Python is the only
language it never hangs on (21/21). This motivated the compaction-threshold investigation
(exp-34), which later *unlocked* TS at full context (exp-38).

### exp-34 — raising lcm context_threshold 0.35 → 0.7 KILLS the 80B stalls
80B, Go+TS × 3 at `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD=0.7`: **0 stalls in 6 runs, Go 3/3 = 1.00** (vs ~4 stalls
in 15 runs, Go 0.67 at 0.35). **The intermittent 25-min hang is a compaction artifact** — at 0.35,
lcm compacts live context at ~92K and truncates the agent's working history mid-build, so it loses
the thread and thrashes to the wall; at 0.7 (compact ~183K) it doesn't. TS still 0.33 but now via
genuine near-misses (0.83–0.92), not hangs. Env var verified end-to-end before the grid.

### exp-35 — context_threshold 0.7 PARTLY fixes the 35B's Rust wall
35B Rust × 3 at 0.7: **1/3 — rep1 PASS (the 35B's first-ever Rust pass, reached 113K context),
rep2/rep3 still stalled** (GENUINE). At 0.35 every Rust run thrashed (0.00). So **Rust is not a
pure capability wall** — the 92K compaction was a real cause — but 0.7 is only a *partial* fix on
the 35B (unlike the 80B on Go/TS, 0/6 stalls). The compaction lever's strength is
model/language-dependent; Rust stays → cloud. (Also found: provenance.json recorded a stale
pre-reload sampling value — verify sampling via oMLX `settings.json`, not provenance.)

### exp-36 — 80B Go promoted at context_threshold 0.7
80B Go × 6 at 0.7: 5/6 (one genuine near-miss), 0 stalls. Combined with exp-34 → **Go 8/9 = 0.89
at 0.7, zero stalls** — up from 0.67-with-2-stalls at 0.35, on par with the 35B. The stall fix
holds at scale; the 80B is now local-viable on Go as well as Python at ctx 0.7.

### exp-37 — 80B Python at 0.7 = 1.00 (an anomaly that was serving degradation)
First pass showed Python 4/6 with 2 fast all-zeros fails — traced to **oMLX serving degradation
after ~12h continuous running**, not a 0.7 effect (Python is 21/21 at 0.35 and never reaches the
compaction point). After **restarting oMLX + disk cleanup**, the retried cells passed →
**Python-at-0.7 = 6/6 = 1.00.** Operational lessons shipped: restart oMLX before a run you'll
trust; `retort run` now does a disk preflight; `monitor --watch` follows the run process.

### exp-38 — full 9-language 80B at full context: TypeScript UNLOCKED
All 9 bookshop languages on the 80B at `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD=0.9` (compact ~236K), n=3 = 27 cells:

| Language | pass | mean req-cov | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| python / go / **typescript** | **3/3** | 1.00 | reliable local (**TS newly, was 0.33**) |
| rust | 1/3 | 0.94 | near-misses → cloud |
| java / erlang | 0/3 | 0.25 / 0.19 | near-miss → cloud |
| clojure / csharp / elixir | 0/3 | 0.00 | GENUINE (no working code) → cloud |

**Full context unlocks TypeScript** (0.33 → 3/3): at 0.9 the agent keeps its whole working history
through the longer TS build. Python/Go stay 3/3, so **0.9 is the recommended 80B config.** Rust's
rep2/rep3 were scorer TOOLING false-failures (code compiles, tests pass 100%; reevaluate gave true
0.92 near-misses) — not stalls. Generator gained a per-stack `routine_scope` so the leading-stacks
headline is scoped to a stack's recommended languages (else the niche 0.00s wrongly rank the 80B
below the 35B). **Process lesson: an all-zeros cell on a capable language ⇒ `retort recover` before
believing it** (4 of 17 fails were tooling false-failures).

### exp-39 — hard task is config-invariant (VERIFIED)
Re-ran brazil on the 80B at ctx 0.9, n=3 (python/go): **0/6, same as exp-31 at 0.7.** python mean
0.75 (rep1 0.917 = 11/12, the closest any local run has come; never all 12); go mean 0.22, and go
rep3 **STALLED** — Go *regressed* at 0.9 because full context makes a non-finishing run thrash
longer (the same downside as exp-38 rust). **Full context is strictly a lever for the easy
languages; it does not raise the hard-task ceiling.** The featured 80B hard column uses exp-39
(0.9) for config-purity. 4/6 fails were scorer TOOLING false-failures (recovered via `retort
recover`).

### exp-41 — self-repair ITERATION 2 does not close the 80B's near-misses

Tested whether a *second* dedicated repair pass (seeded with the iter-1 code + a fresh FEEDBACK.md via
`--repair-from exp-38`) closes the last 1–2 requirements on the 80B's near-misses. Design: rust/java/
erlang × `prompt=repair` × m80 × n=3 (rust rep1 skipped — already 1.0 in exp-38). Post-`recover` (3 of
6 fails were scorer TOOLING false-zeros; the diagnose caught them):

| lang | exp-38 baseline (post-iter-1) | iter-2 repaired req_cov | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **rust** | 0.9167 (11/12) | 0.917, 0.833 | **no gain** — the headline near-miss did NOT close |
| **erlang** | 0.3333 | 0.333, 0.333 | **no change** |
| **java** | 0.75 | 0.917 (rep1) | **+1 req** — the only lift; still <1.0 |

**Headline: iteration-2 self-repair is not a reliable lever.** The most-likely-to-flip cell (Rust at
0.9167) stayed there — a second pass reproduces the same near-miss rather than closing the final
requirement, so **Rust does not become locally viable on the 80B** (stays cloud). Erlang flat. The one
positive is java 0.75→0.92 (repair closed ~1 req on a lower-starting-point cell), but nothing reached
1.0. **Interpretation:** the *default inline* second-chance (iteration-1, which already runs on every
failing cell) captures essentially all the repairable gain; a dedicated iteration-2 mostly re-derives
the same result. **Caveat:** 3 cells (erlang rep3, java rep2/rep3) were INTERRUPTED at ~23 s — a
mid-run hermes/oMLX hiccup, not scored — so java's iter-2 picture is one rep, not three; a
`--resume --retry-failed` re-run would complete it, but wouldn't change the Rust/Erlang verdict.

### exp-43 — C / C++ / Objective-C / Swift exploration (cloud vs local 80B)

First run on the **systems + Apple** tier: `language{c, cpp, objc, swift} × model{Opus 4.8 cloud,
Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B local @ ctx 0.9} × bookshop × n=1` = 8 cells. The point was a first
cloud-vs-local read on four languages new to the harness — and, as much, to *harden the harness* for
them.

**Result (after `retort recover` with all harness fixes applied — req-coverage / spec-gate):**

| lang | Opus 4.8 (cloud) | Qwen 80B (local) |
|---|---|---|
| **c**   | ReqCov **1.0** ✓ | ReqCov **1.0** ✓ — **full pass** (cq 1.00, cov 1.00) |
| **cpp** | ReqCov 1.0 ✓ | ReqCov **0.83** — near-miss (cq 0.93, ~5/6 requirements; a repair candidate like Rust) |
| **objc**| ReqCov 1.0 ✓ | fail — wrote 1134 loc ObjC but **no build system / tests** (genuine incomplete) |
| **swift**| ReqCov 1.0 ✓ | fail — real SwiftPM/Vapor project, build/test didn't pass (genuine) |

**Headline:** the **frontier sweeps 4/4**; the **80B fully implements the C bookshop (ReqCov 1.0)**
and near-misses C++ (0.83) — much stronger on the systems tier than the *raw* run suggested, and
better than it does on several "niche" languages. ObjC/Swift are genuine incompletes (no runnable
tests / a broken Vapor build). So the systems-tier gap is **C/C++ are locally viable-to-close; the
Apple frameworks are not yet**.

**⚠️ The number that moved most was a HARNESS bug, not the model.** The raw run scored local-C
**0.00**; `retort recover` (with the new server-reaping fix) flipped it to **1.00**. The 80B's C was
*always* correct — its integration test backgrounded a server that leaked and squatted port 8765, so
the retry and scorer hit "address already in use" and false-failed working code. Six harness bugs in
total surfaced and were fixed *before* any conclusion was drawn (below); the recovered numbers above
are the honest result. Textbook "suspect the harness before the model": publishing the raw run would
have claimed "the 80B can't write C," which is flatly false.

**The harness hardening — the real yield of the run** (all fixed + regression-tested):
1. **hermes not on PATH** → all 4 local cells crashed at 0.0s → `serving.hermes_bin` + a new
   **local-agent binary preflight** (`retort run` now warns up front instead of crashing every cell).
2. **C has no canonical test format** — three real bookshops used three formats (TAP, `N checks, M
   failures`, bare names) → make the **test-command exit code the universal pass signal** in
   `_native_coverage`, plus TAP + broadened summary patterns.
3. **Swift 6 uses Swift Testing** (`@Suite`/`@Test`), not XCTest → added its patterns + a `swift test`
   exit-code fallback + a 900s timeout (SwiftPM/Vapor builds are slow).
4. **DEVELOPER_DIR** auto-resolution so Swift/ObjC XCTest works when `xcode-select` points at the CLT.
5. **`.build` (SwiftPM vendored deps) wasn't skipped** → swift loc inflated ~1000× (834K vs ~200) →
   added to `SKIP_PARTS`.
6. **`retort monitor --watch`** exited immediately / hid the running cell for `cd <exp> && retort run`
   launches → detect the run process by **cwd**, not just argv.
7. **Leaked server processes** (the big one) — a model's integration test backgrounds a real server
   that outlives the test command, keeps LISTENing, and false-fails the retry + later cells with
   "address already in use" → `_run_reaped` runs every test command in its own process group and
   SIGKILLs the group afterward (temp-file output + `wait()`, since a backgrounded server holds the
   stdout pipe open and blocks `communicate()`). This is what flipped local-C 0.00 → 1.00 on recover.

Full scorer support (build/test/coverage/lint) for c/cpp/objc/swift landed here — see the README
toolchain table. Remaining follow-up: give ObjC/Swift-local a fair shot — the 80B produced ObjC
source with no build system and a Vapor Swift app that won't build in-env; a lighter task variant or
a build-scaffold nudge would separate "can't" from "didn't scaffold."

### exp-44 — Graphify tooling factor on a modify-existing Python task (frontier arm)

First run of the **tooling: graphify** factor (a pre-built code knowledge graph) on the new
**modify-existing** task `py-catalog-reservations` (add a reservations feature to a seeded
catalog/ library; scored on req-coverage of the new capability AND a no_regression gate that the
seed's existing suite still passes). Design: `tooling{none, beads, graphify} × Opus 4.8 × n=3` = 9
cells, cloud-first to isolate the tooling effect from local-capability noise.

**Result — tooling is a NO-OP on correctness here; it only costs time:**

| tooling | req_cov | no_regression | code_quality | mean duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **none**     | **1.0** | 1.0 | 0.833 | **79 s** |
| **beads**    | **1.0** | 1.0 | 0.833 | 132 s (**+67%**) |
| **graphify** | **1.0** | 1.0 | 0.833 | 86 s (+9%) |

All three sweep 3/3 at perfect req-coverage and no-regression. **beads actively costs 67% more wall
time** (the issue-tracking loop) for zero correctness gain; **graphify's graph-build + consultation
adds ~9%** and also changes nothing. This is the same shape as the prompt blog's finding, now for
*tooling*: **on a strong model + an easy task, tooling is a lever only in proportion to model
weakness — here, zero.** The catalog seed is ~5 modules / ~200 lines, which a frontier model
navigates without a map.

**This is the control, not the headline.** Graphify's value proposition is comprehending a *large*
existing codebase, so a clean null on a *small* one is exactly what predicts where it *should* bite.
The plumbing itself is validated: the consultation smoke confirmed Opus genuinely used the graph (4×
GRAPH_REPORT.md reads + `graphify explain`/`query`/`path`), so this null is "tooling didn't help," not
"tooling was ignored." New reusable machinery landed here: the `tooling: graphify` capability, the
`no_regression` scorer, and a seed-based modify-existing task type (`seed/` → support_dir).

### exp-45 — Graphify tooling on the LOCAL 80B (the weaker-model arm)

Same design as exp-44 (`tooling{none,beads,graphify} × catalog × n=3`) but on the local
**Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B** — the "does a weaker model need the map?" half. **Result: identical null —
all three tooling levels 1.0 req_cov + 1.0 no_regression** (graphify 170 s ≈ none 181 s; beads +43 %).
The 80B solves this small modify-existing task cleanly unaided, just like Opus.

**✅ Consultation caveat RESOLVED (2026-07-24).** Initially the local null was ambiguous — Hermes
writes only a minimal ~11-line stdout with no tool-call log, so grepping the transcript found nothing
and we couldn't tell "consulted-but-didn't-need-it" from "ignored-it." But Hermes DOES persist the
full transcript in its SQLite session store, keyed by the `session_id` in `.hermes_usage.json`. A new
`_export_hermes_session` (writes `_hermes_session.jsonl` after each Hermes run) + a cross-agent
`agent_consulted()` detector make it verifiable — and, exported retroactively for exp-45, **all three
graphify cells DID consult the graph** (95–115 tool_call refs, `GRAPH_REPORT.md` reads each). So the
80B null is genuinely **"used the graph, didn't help,"** exactly like Opus — not a logging artifact.
This unblocks the funkygibbon large-repo arm, where "did the agent actually use the graph?" is the
whole question.

**Combined §1 conclusion (exp-44 + exp-45):** on a *small* modify-existing task, tooling
(none/beads/graphify) is a no-op on correctness for **both** the frontier and the local 80B — a
~200-line seed is navigable without a map, and beads only adds wall-time. The real test of Graphify's
value stays the **large-repo** arm (funkygibbon-port / the-goodies ~30K lines), where navigation is
the actual bottleneck.

### exp-55 — Terra vs Opus 5 at matched thinking levels: 4× to 40× for the same result

The first **cross-vendor, matched-effort** comparison. GPT-5.6's tiers price onto the Claude ladder
(Luna↔Sonnet, **Terra↔Opus**, Sol↔Fable), and Opus is the optimal Claude pick in most cells, so Terra
is its price-peer. `{gpt-5.6-terra, claude-opus-5} × {low, medium, high, xhigh, max} × {python, go} ×
n=2` on bookshop = 40 runs, judged by opus-4.8. **40/40 completed, every cell 1.00.**

| effort | Terra | Opus 5 | ratio | Terra time | Opus 5 time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| low | \$0.19 | \$0.81 | 4.3× | 112 s | 136 s |
| medium | \$0.15 | \$1.15 | 7.5× | 105 s | 222 s |
| high | \$0.18 | \$1.84 | 10.4× | 132 s | 401 s |
| xhigh | \$0.22 | \$4.63 | 20.7× | 169 s | 909 s |
| **max** | **\$0.35** | **\$14.21** | **40.1×** | 254 s | 1669 s |

**Terra's most expensive setting is still half the price of Opus 5's cheapest** (\$0.35 vs \$0.81),
and 40× cheaper at matched `max` — for an identical, independently-verified 1.00. Total experiment
cost: \$80.67, of which Opus 5 at `max` alone is a third.

**The mechanism is in the step counts, and it is the real finding.** Terra's agent steps stay
**flat across the entire dial — 10 to 19** regardless of setting. Opus 5's **explode: 15 → 23 → 22 →
43 → 140 turns.**

So the dial does structurally different things in the two systems. On Opus 5 it buys **more agentic
iteration**, which triggers the n²-ish cache-read growth documented in
[versions-blog](../versions-blog.md) — hence \$14.21 and 28 minutes for a CRUD API. On Terra it
appears to buy **deeper reasoning inside a roughly constant number of steps**, so cost rises ~2×
rather than ~18×. That is why the ratio *widens* with effort instead of holding at the ~2.4× the
per-token rates alone imply: roughly half the gap is pricing, half is token volume driven by turns.

**Why effort had to be set explicitly.** `default` is not a shared operating point — Claude's sits
near `high`, Terra's is `medium`, Sol's is `low`. Comparing defaults would have compared two vendors'
product decisions rather than two models, and would have shown a muddled ~9× instead of the clean
4×→40× interaction.

**Two plumbing bugs were fixed first, either of which would have invalidated the sweep:** `xhigh` was
missing from retort's effort levels (so exp-49's "five-level" sweep had actually skipped a real
level), and **codex ignored the effort factor entirely** — it has no `--effort` flag, the level is a
config key, so every codex cell would have run at the model's default while the design claimed to
sweep it. Now `-c model_reasoning_effort=<level>`, verified live because the API *rejects* an invalid
value.

*Caveats:* n=2 per cell (n=4 pooled across languages), bookshop only. Go's Opus 5 `max` came in
*below* its `xhigh` — non-monotonic, and a reminder that single cells are soft. Terra's cost rests on
a **92% cache-hit rate**; without the cached-input discount it would be ~3.3× higher, and that hit
rate is partly an artifact of retort running many cells behind an identical prompt prefix. Codex
reports no per-request context, so peak-context is blank for those cells — see the notes in
`_parse_codex_usage`.

### exp-56 — Terra clears every remaining language, both tasks, for \$7.44

The gap-fill for exp-55: `gpt-5.6-terra` via codex at **default effort** (its own default, medium),
1 replicate, across the nine languages Terra had never been run on, on **both** tasks. Judge held at
opus-4.8.

**18/18 at `requirement_coverage` 1.00 as originally run. Total spend: \$7.44.**

**Corrected 2026-08-17 (M1 review).** That 18/18 was accurate for the design as run, which
DELIBERATELY excluded swift and objc — `xcode-select` pointed at CommandLineTools, so either would
have scored a harness false zero. After the Xcode fix those four arms were added via `--resume`, and
the experiment now stands at **21 of 22**:

| | result |
|---|---|
| bookshop | 11/11 |
| brazil | 10/11 — **objc fails the MECHANICAL gate** (`tests did not run, test_coverage=0`) |

The headline "clears every remaining language, both tasks" is therefore true of bookshop and of ten
of eleven brazil languages, not of all of them. **The objc failure is not a Terra capability wall
and should not be read as one:** exp-46 scored objc 1.00 on this same task with Opus 5, so the
language and its scorer both work here. It is an unexplained mechanical-gate failure in this cell
and wants `retort diagnose`, not a conclusion.

| language | bookshop | brazil |
|---|---:|---:|
| typescript | 1.00 · \$0.22 | 1.00 · \$0.15 * |
| rust | 1.00 · \$0.14 | 1.00 · \$0.37 |
| java | 1.00 · \$0.38 | 1.00 · \$0.49 |
| clojure | 1.00 · \$0.33 | 1.00 · \$0.57 |
| erlang | 1.00 · \$0.34 | 1.00 · \$0.49 |
| elixir | 1.00 · \$0.42 | 1.00 · \$0.67 |
| csharp | 1.00 · \$0.26 | 1.00 · \$1.36 |
| c | 1.00 · \$0.26 | 1.00 · \$0.40 |
| cpp | 1.00 · \$0.26 | 1.00 · \$0.33 |

\* typescript/brazil passed on the **self-repair second chance** — the first attempt scored 0.9167
(11 of 12 requirements) and the repair closed it. Every other cell passed first time.

Put beside exp-46, where Opus 5 also went 13/13 on both tasks: Opus 5 spent **\$2.55–\$39.05 per
brazil cell**; Terra's dearest here is **\$1.36**. Clojure, C#, Elixir and Erlang — the languages
that wall the local 80B at 0.00 — are cleared for well under a dollar apiece.

**Effort was deliberately not swept.** exp-55 measured the dial as near-inert on Terra (\$0.12–\$0.29
across all five levels, every cell 1.00), so a 9 × 5 sweep would have re-measured a known flat
factor. `default` is what a user actually gets.

**Two scorer bugs surfaced, and both were false zeros on green code** — the pattern this project
keeps paying for. Neither was a model failure:

1. **typescript/bookshop scored 0.00 on every response.** The agent used Node's *built-in* runner
   with zero dependencies. The `node --test` branch matched and the tests ran; only the summary went
   unread, because the pattern accepted TAP's `# pass 7` while Node 26 emits its default spec
   reporter's `ℹ pass 3`. Verified by hand: 3/3 pass, exit 0. Pattern now takes both markers.
2. **csharp/brazil scored 0.00.** The agent shipped `App.csproj` + `App.Tests.csproj` at the root
   with no `.sln`, so a bare `dotnet test` exits on **MSB1011** ("more than one project or solution
   file") *before running anything*. The scorer already had an explicit-test-project path but only
   used it when the root held **no** project — an ambiguous root fails exactly like an empty one.
   Verified by hand: 5/5 pass. Both cells rescored and re-judged (ReqCov 1.0), with regression tests.

**swift and objc were excluded, and that was a harness call, not a result.** Full Xcode is installed
but `xcode-select` points at CommandLineTools, so `xcodebuild` errors and a minimal SwiftPM package
fails with "no such module 'XCTest'" (reproduced before launch). Either would have scored a false
zero indistinguishable from a capability wall. They need
`sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` and then 4 runs via `--resume`.

*Caveats:* n=1 per cell. The two recovered cells were re-judged with `--eval-model opus-4.8`
explicitly — `retort reevaluate` otherwise falls back to the CLI's default judge, which would have
graded them under a different model than the other 16.

### exp-57 — the first correctness gate, and 3 perfect checklists that are wrong

**gpt-5.6-luna × brazil × {python, go} × n=3**, judge opus-4.8, **\$1.01 / 17 min**. The first
experiment to run the new `factual_accuracy` gate, which starts the finished server and checks two
externally-verifiable facts about the 2019 Série A (Flamengo 28W-6D-4L, all 20 clubs) — both stated
in the task's own worked example.

**2 of 6 pass. Five of six scored `requirement_coverage` 1.00, and three of those ship a
demonstrably wrong 2019 table** — clean passes under the old gates.

| lang | rep | req_cov | factual | defect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| python | 2 | 1.00 | 1.00 | — |
| go | 2 | 1.00 | 1.00 | — |
| go | 1 | 1.00 | 0.50 | **76 played, 180 points** — exactly double 38/90: the five overlapping match files concatenated without dedup |
| python | 1,3 | 1.00 | 0.50 | `Athletico Paranaense` 27 + `Atletico Paranaense` 11 = 38 — one club split across two spellings, giving a 21-club division |
| go | 3 | 0.92 | 0.00 | 223-row "standings"; Athletico Paranaense split FOUR ways (`Atletico Paranaense` 46, `Atletico-PR` 38, `Athletico Paranaense - PR` 8, `Athletico` 8); no competition filter, so it cannot produce the spec's own worked example |

Every one of these implements the checklist, returns a table, and satisfies the accounting identity
`matches == wins+draws+losses` — within each fragment. That is exactly why the pinned checklist
cannot see it: it asks whether a capability exists, never whether its numbers are right.

**The dominant defect is name normalisation, not deduplication.** §0 predicted double-counting from
one run's log; only one cell shows it. Three show a club's season split across spellings the loader
never canonicalised — the hazard the task text explicitly warns about (`São Paulo-SP` vs
`Sao Paulo`). One run wrote a perfectly good normaliser and then keyed its standings map on the raw
string.

**Harness cost of getting here: 6 bugs, every one of which failed CORRECT work.** Four in the
scorer's own parsing (literal "38" lookup reading the points column; counting table-shaped lines and
catching a relegation-summary line as a 21st club; one name token per club; single-line JSON output
collapsing to one row), and two outside it — `go build -o X .` emitting a package ARCHIVE at mode
0644 for the idiomatic `cmd/<name>/main.go` layout while exiting 0, and a tool schema declaring
`required: ["season"]` with no `properties` block, so the probe never asked for 2019 and was
answered with all-time standings. The uncorrected run recorded 0/6; the truth is 2/6.

**Two gate-plumbing bugs found the same day, both of which silently un-did the gate:**
`factual_failed` drove `run_ok` — the console verdict and the `rep<N>-failed` archive name — but was
omitted from the argument that sets the stored DB status, so a failing run was recorded `completed`
and every downstream consumer saw a pass. And `retort rescore` reclassified on `test_coverage`
alone, flipping all six runs back to `completed RECOVERED`. A recovery path that resurrects runs a
gate rejected is worse than no recovery path.

**Standing caveat:** pass/fail now answers a different question than it did for the 284 pre-gate
brazil runs. `REQUIREMENTS.json` is untouched, so `requirement_coverage` still pools; any write-up
that pools *pass-proportions* across that boundary must say so.


### exp-58 — GPT-5.6 Sol, and the gap the checklist hides

**`gpt-5.6-sol` × brazil × {python, go, rust, typescript} × n=3**, its own default effort,
judge opus-4.8, **\$27.97 / ~75 min**. Sol is the new frontier Codex model
(`models_cache.json`, 2026-08-12: *"Latest frontier agentic coding model"*); master.db had only
terra and luna.

**10 of 12 pass with facts checked. 11 of 12 pass the checklist alone.** Head-to-head on the hard
task, same gate, same judge:

| model | n | checklist only | with facts |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| gpt-5.6-luna | 6 | 0.83 | **0.33** |
| gpt-5.6-sol | 12 | 0.92 | **0.83** |

**The checklist barely separates these models; correctness separates them 2.5x.** That is the
clearest evidence yet for §0's premise — `requirement_coverage` measures whether a capability exists,
and on a task where the data is messy, existence and correctness diverge sharply for the weaker
model.

**Sol's two genuine failures are both worth naming:**
- **python rep3** declares `mcp>=1.28,<3` and uses `@server.list_tools()`, which exists in mcp 1.x
  and was **removed in 2.0**. Its own manifest specifies a version its own code cannot run against:
  install it as shipped and it crashes on start-up. Verified directly — `Server.list_tools` is
  present in 1.29.0, absent in 2.0.0.
- **typescript rep1** reports Flamengo at 55 played / 37 wins and splits Athletico across four rows.
  It also missed the checklist (0.92), so it was the one cell the old gate would have caught anyway.

**Cost and speed, versus terra:** sol runs **\$2.33/cell and 7.7 min median** against terra's
\$0.77 and 457 s on the same task — roughly 3x the price for +0.05 checklist reliability. Seven of
twelve cells needed the self-repair second chance (`ok*`, half credit).

**Two settings recorded because they are NOT comparable across models:** sol's own default reasoning
level is **`low`**, terra's is `medium` — "default effort" is not one setting. And a **new effort
level `ultra`** exists above `max` on sol/terra/luna, which exp-55's sweep never saw. Both queued.

**Harness cost: 2 more parser fixes, both failing CORRECT work** — a structured row whose JSON keys
are alphabetical (so the consecutive-`[28,6,4]` check missed a perfect answer), and a response that
puts a text preamble before pretty-printed JSON (parsing neither as JSON nor line-wise). The
uncorrected run recorded 8/12; the truth is 10/12. That makes **eight distinct output shapes** this
scorer has had to learn across two experiments — the format diversity across implementations of one
specification is itself a finding.


### exp-59 — `ultra`: 9.7x the cost, 8x the time, and nothing to show for it

**`gpt-5.6-terra` @ `ultra` × brazil × {python, go} × n=3**, judge opus-4.8, **\$22.80 / ~3.1 h**.
A sixth reasoning level exists on Sol/Terra/Luna above `max`. exp-49 and exp-55 both swept low..max
and stopped — not by choice: the codex launch path accepted `ultra` through an ad-hoc exception while
the only named list ended at `max`. **A gap nothing names is a gap nobody sees.**

**6 of 6 pass, on both the checklist and the factual gate.** So does every level below it. The
completed sweep, terra on brazil, python and go:

| effort | n | checklist | avg cost | avg minutes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| low | 2 | 1.00 | \$0.39 | 3.9 |
| medium | 2 | 1.00 | \$0.39 | 4.0 |
| high | 2 | 1.00 | \$0.50 | 5.8 |
| xhigh | 2 | 1.00 | \$1.25 | 13.2 |
| max | 2 | 1.00 | \$2.77 | 25.0 |
| **ultra** | 6 | **1.00** | **\$3.80** | **31.1** |

**Reliability is flat across the entire dial while cost rises 9.7x and wall-clock 8x.** One `ultra`
cell took **50.6 minutes** and \$7.52 to reach the same 1.00 that `low` reached in 3.9 minutes for
\$0.39. This is exp-49's "4x cost lever that buys nothing on routine work" extended to the hard task
and to a tier the vendor added after that conclusion was drawn.

**Two of six `ultra` cells still needed the self-repair second chance** (half credit), which `low`
and `medium` did not — so the extra reasoning did not even buy first-attempt reliability.

**`ultra` is the only level in this table whose answers were checked.** exp-55's cells predate the
factual gate, so their `factual_accuracy` is NULL and they pass it by construction. The honest
comparison is on `requirement_coverage`, which pools cleanly and is what the table reports;
`ultra`'s own factual score is 1.00 on all 6. What is NOT established is whether the lower levels
would also answer correctly — that is a re-run, not an inference, and the flat checklist result makes
it a low-priority one.

**Caveat on n.** The low..max rows are n=2 each (exp-55, python+go, one replicate per language);
`ultra` is n=6. A flat line across six levels is still the cleanest reading, but the lower rows are
thin and a single failure would move them a lot.

**Harness fix that came with it:** `ultra` is now a named level —
`CODEX_ONLY_EFFORT_LEVELS = ("ultra",)`, with `CODEX_EFFORT_LEVELS` composing it — instead of an
`and effort != "ultra"` exception buried in the launch path. `CROSS_VENDOR_EFFORT_LEVELS` still
excludes it: Claude has no counterpart, so it is not a like-for-like operating point.


### exp-55b — the same sweep on the HARD task: 28× the cost, and the gap the pass metric hides

The brazil half of exp-55: `{gpt-5.6-terra, claude-opus-5} × {low, medium, high, xhigh, max} ×
{python, go} × n=1` = 20 runs, judge held at opus-4.8. **20/20 completed, every cell 1.00** — so on
the 12-capability MCP task, at every thinking level, in both languages, both models fully implement
the spec.

| | Terra | Opus 5 | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| total cost, 10 cells | **\$10.58** | **\$296.08** | **28×** |
| total wall clock | 1.7 h | 7.6 h | 4.5× |
| cheapest passing cell | \$0.31 (python, high) | \$7.03 (go, low) | 23× |
| dearest passing cell | \$3.36 (go, max) | **\$85.45** (go, max) | 25× |

That \$85.45 / 98-minute run is **the most expensive single run this project has recorded**, and the
`low` cell of the same stack passed the identical checklist in 16 minutes for \$7.03.

**The finding that matters is what `requirement_coverage` cannot see.** All 20 cells are 1.00, but
the mechanical scorers are not equal:

| | `test_coverage` | range |
|---|---:|---|
| Opus 5, python | **0.98** | 0.95–1.00 |
| Terra, python | 0.82 | 0.69–0.88 |
| Opus 5, go | **0.88** | 0.86–0.90 |
| Terra, go | 0.56 | **0.27**–0.66 |

Opus ships materially better-tested code on the hard task — on Go it is 0.88 against Terra's 0.56,
with one Terra cell at **0.27**. So "Terra matches Opus at 1/28th the cost" is true *of spec
conformance* and false of test depth. The pinned checklist asks whether each capability exists, and
a thinly-tested implementation answers yes. Anyone reading the cost ratio as "same result" is reading
one column of four. (`code_quality` and `maintainability` are near-identical between them, so the
gap is specifically in testing, not in the code.)

**Effort still buys nothing on the pass metric here** — 1.00 at `low` and 1.00 at `max`, for 8× the
money. Behavioural detail of what Opus does with the extra time is in
[levels-blog](../levels-blog.md); briefly, the hard task is revision-heavy at *every* level
(Edit:Write > 0.9 even at `low`), unlike the routine task where writing dominates until `max`.

*Caveats:* n=1 per cell — these are single observations, and this project has reversed n=1 results
before. **One cell has no cost at all:** Opus 5 / go / `medium` completed and scored 1.00, but its
agent log was never written, so `_cost_usd` is NULL and tokens read 0 — the \$296.08 is a **lower
bound**, and the missing telemetry is filed as a harness bug (a completed run with no usage data
should fail loudly, because a missing cost and a free run are indistinguishable downstream). The
first resume attempt also crashed 3 cells in <1 s on `Not logged in` after the credential store was
blanked; those rows were re-run, not recorded.

### exp-53 — Codex joins the board, and is an order of magnitude cheaper

The first OpenAI-lineage agent in this corpus. Every cloud result before this was Claude (plus one
Gemini scaffold), so "which stack should I use" had never been answerable outside one vendor.
`codex exec` × `gpt-5.6-luna` × bookshop × {python, go, typescript} × n=3, prompt=neutral, judged by
**opus-4.8** — the same judge as every other experiment here, so the numbers pool.

| language | n | pass | cost | time | tokens |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **python** | 3 | **1.00** | **\$0.062** | 145 s | 171 K |
| **go** | 3 | **1.00** | **\$0.084** | 127 s | 245 K |
| typescript | 3 | 0.00 | \$0.116 | 186 s | 408 K |

**On the same python cell: Opus 4.8 \$0.67, Fable 5 \$1.24, Opus 5 \$2.27 — all also 1.00.** Codex
reaches the same verified result for roughly **11× less than Opus 4.8 and 37× less than Opus 5**.
That is the largest cost gap in the corpus, and it is n=3 on one routine task — a starting point, not
a verdict.

**That price only exists because of a fix made the same day.** A ChatGPT subscription reports no
per-run cost, so before `retort.pricing` landed Codex would have recorded **\$0** — and
`per_language_routing` picks the cheapest qualifying stack, so it would have won every recommendation
it qualified for on a number nobody measured. Cost here is list-price-per-token, the same basis
Claude's CLI reports (and does not bill on a Max plan).

**TypeScript 0.00 is a GENUINE failure, and the reasoning matters.** All three runs chose
`better-sqlite3`, which will not build under this machine's Node 26; `npm install` is all-or-nothing,
so `tsx` never installed either and the suite never ran. The tempting reading is "environment
incompatibility, not the model's fault" — **and the transcript refutes it.** The agent ran:

```
npm test                       -> sh: tsx: command not found
npm install                    -> (failed, node-gyp)
npm run build                  -> sh: tsc: command not found
npm install --ignore-scripts …
```

It watched its own suite fail, attempted the same workaround the scorer now uses, and finished
anyway — on a **repair** attempt where it had already been told it failed. An agent executing in the
playpen can inspect the target machine. Choosing a dependency that does not build there and shipping
untested code is a model failure, and the same model passed python and go on the same machine.

*(The scorer now retries `npm install --ignore-scripts` when a full install fails. That is a
diagnostic aid — it turns an opaque zero into "Could not locate the bindings file" — not an excuse
for the run.)*

**Three integration bugs were found first, each only visible by running the real CLI** (see PR #45's
review thread): the telemetry parser was written to an event shape `codex exec --json` does not emit
(returned 0 tokens / 0 turns on real output); `output_tokens` and `input_tokens` were double-counted
against their own subsets (~490 % cost inflation); and Codex's `turn.completed` fires **once per exec
invocation**, not per agent step, so recording it as `num_turns` would have put Codex at the bottom
of the turn axis and made it look radically more efficient than every measured stack. `num_turns` is
deliberately absent for Codex; `codex_items` / `codex_exec_turns` carry the data under honest names.

*Caveats:* n=3, one task, one tier at its default reasoning level. GPT-5.6 ships three tiers
(Sol/Terra/Luna) each with its own effort dial, so this measures one point in a 3 × 5 grid. Also
`gpt-5.x-codex` model ids are **API-key-only** — on a ChatGPT plan they 400; the usable set is in
`~/.codex/models_cache.json`.

### exp-50 — the local hard-task wall is real for unattended runs, and breachable with feedback

Re-ran exp-39 unchanged except for the turn cap: `Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B × brazil-bench ×
{python, go} × n=3`, ctx 0.9, 120-min wall. 6/6 completed.

| language | rep1 | rep2 | rep3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| python | **1.00** (51 turns) | **1.00** (34) | 0.9167 (27) |
| go | **1.00** (56 turns) | 0.8333 (57) | 0.8333 (28) |

**3 of 6 runs fully implemented the hard task** — against exp-31/39's **0 of 12**. The 80B *can* do
brazil-bench, which the published "config-invariant capability wall" said it never does.

**But every single pass came on the self-repair SECOND attempt.** All six runs carry
`_second_try=1.0`: each failed its first unattended pass and was re-seeded with its own code plus the
evaluation feedback. **First-attempt, unattended: 0/6 — exactly exp-39's result.** Since retort counts a
second-try pass at half credit, the pass-proportion is **0.25**, not 0.50.

So the correct reading is narrow and more interesting than either extreme: **the 80B reliably reaches
~11 of 12 capabilities and cannot close the last one on its own, but given its own output and a
specific critique it closes it about half the time.** That is a claim about feedback loops, not raw
capability, and it connects directly to exp-41's self-repair work. "Hard tasks → cloud" stands for
unattended use; a local stack with a repair loop is a genuinely different proposition.

**⚠️ THE PREMISE OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS WRONG, and the write-up is kept honest about it.** It was
launched on the theory that a 30-turn Hermes cap had been truncating exp-39. That theory came from
reading archived `api_calls` as **3 per turn**, making "90 api_calls" look like 3 × the cap. exp-50
records `api_calls` **and** `_turns` for the same runs and they are **1:1** (python 51 = 51, go 56 =
56). So exp-39's runs took 32–90 turns — *above* the supposed cap — and none hit the 60-minute wall
(longest 3016 s). **Nothing truncated exp-39; it fell short on merit.** The remaining explanation for
exp-50's passes is the serving stack having moved (oMLX 0.5.0rc1) or ordinary variance around a
threshold the model already sat on. The `max_turns` plumbing fix stands on its own — retort should not
silently disagree with its own declared config — it just isn't what this experiment measured.

*Method note:* this is the fourth time in this project that a single early run pointed one way and the
replicates pointed another. The first two cells here were both 1.00 and read as a clean overturn; at
n=6 the honest number is 0.25.

### exp-49 — thinking level: a 4× cost lever that buys nothing on routine work

The first experiment to treat **thinking level** (`claude --effort`) as a factor. Every result this
project had published ran at whatever the CLI chose by default, unrecorded — a confound sitting on
[versions-blog](../versions-blog.md)'s central claim that newer models take more turns. Design:
`{Opus 4.7, 4.8, Fable 5, Opus 5} × {default, low, medium, high, max}` + a `4.8-fast` serving control,
all on `python × bookshop × neutral`, **n=3 → 63 runs. 63/63 completed, 0 failures.**

**Headline 1 — effort is a large cost lever and a zero reliability lever.**

| effort | turns | tokens | cost | seconds | **pass** | n |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **low** | **10.3** | **277 K** | **\$0.71** | **75** | **1.00** | 12 |
| medium | 12.4 | 340 K | \$0.84 | 95 | **1.00** | 12 |
| *default (CLI's own choice)* | 15.3 | 430 K | \$0.94 | 135 | **1.00** | 15 |
| high | 17.4 | 571 K | \$1.08 | 180 | **1.00** | 12 |
| max | 21.7 | 995 K | \$2.90 | 462 | **1.00** | 12 |

low → max costs **2.1× the turns, 3.6× the tokens, 4.1× the money and 6.2× the wall-clock** — for an
**identical 1.00**. Every one of the 62 telemetry-bearing runs passed, at every level, on every model.
**On routine work the thinking knob is pure expense.** Even against the CLI default, `low` is ~25%
cheaper and ~45% faster with no measured reliability cost — and the default is *not* the cheapest
setting, it sits between `medium` and `high`.

**Headline 2 — the version "progression" was mostly an artifact of one old experiment.**
versions-blog described a smooth climb: Fable 5 10.7 → Opus 4.8 17.3 → Opus 5 36.0 turns. Measured
**in-batch at default effort**, three generations are indistinguishable and only Opus 5 moves:

| model | in-batch turns (n=3) | published | ratio | source of the published figure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Opus 4.8-fast | 11.5 | 11.3 | **1.02×** | exp-7 |
| Fable 5 | 13.0 | 10.7 | 1.21× | exp-10 |
| Opus 5 | 31.0 | 36.0 | **0.86×** | exp-46 |
| **Opus 4.7** | **10.3** | 17.2 | **0.60×** | **exp-6** |
| **Opus 4.8** | **9.3** | 17.3 | **0.54×** | **exp-6** |

Three of five replicate within ~15%. **The two that do not are both from exp-6**, the oldest source —
so this is not general noise but something specific to that experiment's harness era. Corrected, the
finding is sharper than the original: **Opus 4.7, 4.8 and Fable 5 all sit around 9–13 turns; Opus 5
alone takes ~2.7×.** The "gradual climb across versions" was exp-6's inflated middle.

**Headline 3 — effort and version interact; Opus 5 amplifies the knob.** low → max multiplies turns by
1.9× (4.7), 1.5× (4.8) and 1.7× (Fable 5) — but **2.8× for Opus 5** (15.7 → 43.7), and its cost goes
**\$0.75 → \$6.75, a 9× swing**, with wall-clock 114 s → 1110 s. The most expensive model is also the
one most sensitive to the most expensive setting.

**A retraction this experiment forced on itself.** The preliminary smoke cell that motivated the whole
run measured Opus 4.8 × max at **33 turns / 1.62 M tokens**, which was published as "thinking level
alone reproduces most of the cross-version turn gap." In-batch the same cell came in at **14, 18 and 14
turns (mean 15.3)**. The claim was wrong and is retracted in all four documents that carried it. Note
the smoke cell was run *concurrently with exp-48* — a violation of the one-experiment-at-a-time rule —
and its 33 sits far outside the in-batch range, which is suggestive but not proof of contamination.

**A harness bug this experiment exposed.** `retort aggregate` promoted a **hardcoded** list of factors
into `master.db`, so all 63 runs aggregated with `effort` **silently dropped** — recorded in the
experiment's own `retort.db`, absent from `master.db`, no error raised. Every cross-experiment analysis
of the new factor would have been impossible, and nothing would have said so. Fixed: `FACTORS` now
includes `effort`/`agent`/`stack`, and `unknown_factors()` reports any factor key present in the data
with no column, which `aggregate` prints as a warning. Three regression tests.

**The local half (6 runs) — and the local stacks finally get onto the turn axis.** Historical Hermes
runs recorded no turn count at all, so [versions-blog](../versions-blog.md) could only compare local to
cloud by *profile shape* (tokens and seconds). Measured directly:

| stack | n | turns | tokens | seconds | coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-35B (local) | 3 | **12.0** (10, 8, 18) | 288 K | 183 | 0.98 |
| Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B (local) | 3 | **24.7** (44, 17, 13) | 595 K | 205 | 0.95 |

Against the cloud arms at default effort the whole board orders as: **Opus 4.8 9.3 < Opus 4.7 10.3 <
35B 12.0 < Fable 5 13.0 < 80B 24.7 < Opus 5 31.0.** Two readings:

- **A 35B open-weights model on a laptop takes the same ~12 turns as the cloud frontier.** The
  "three generations flat at ~10 turns" cluster is not a Claude phenomenon; it spans vendors and a 20×
  size difference.
- **versions-blog's inference holds.** It claimed the 80B "mirrors Opus 5's profile" from tokens and
  seconds alone, before turns were recorded. On the turn axis: 24.7 vs 31.0 — close, and both far above
  everything else. The inference was sound.

Note the 80B's **variance is large** (44, 17, 13 — a 3.4× spread), much larger than the 35B's or any
cloud arm's. n=3 is thin for a stack that noisy, and a single 80B run is close to meaningless.

**Two harness faults surfaced in the local half, both caught by guards rather than published:**

1. **The 30-turn cap** (fixed before this half ran — see the commit). One of the three 80B runs took
   **44 turns**, so the old cap would have truncated it *on the routine task*. This is direct evidence
   that the cap was binding on real work, not merely arithmetically possible.
2. **oMLX 0.5.0rc1's memory enforcer refused to load the 80B.** Its `balanced` tier ceiling (~42.7 GB)
   is *below the model's own size* (43.85 GB), and the projection including a 262144-token KV cache is
   ~51.6 GB. All three m80 cells wrote nothing and failed in 8–10 s; the **no-write guard aborted the
   run** rather than recording false zeros, and the instant-failure-for-$0 signature matched the
   documented tell exactly. Fixed with an explicit `--memory-guard-gb 54` (under the kernel's ~56 GB
   Metal wired cap). **exp-38/39 ran this same model under plain `balanced`, which cannot have passed
   this enforcer — so it arrived or tightened in 0.5.0rc1, making the serving-layer *version* an
   uncontrolled stack variable in a project premised on the stack mattering.**

*Caveats:* one run (fast-mode rep3) persisted partial telemetry, so the **fast-mode control is n=2**.
All results are one language (Python) on the routine task — thinking level may well earn its cost on
harder work, which this experiment does not test. That is the obvious follow-up. The local arms carry
no `effort` factor (it is a Claude CLI flag with no Hermes equivalent), so they sit at their own
defaults and are comparable to the cloud arms' `default` column only.

### exp-48 — Fable 5 fills its gaps, and Opus 5's headline does not survive it

exp-46 crowned Opus 5 "the only model that clears the hard task in every language." That comparison was
**not like-for-like**: Fable 5 had only ever run 4 of the 13 languages (clojure/go/python/rust) on each
task, so its silence on the other 9 was mistaken for absence of capability. This experiment filled the
gap — `Fable 5 × the 9 missing languages × {bookshop, brazil-bench}` = 18 cells, n=1, prompt=neutral,
spec-gate ON, with the **120-minute wall** exp-46 learned it needed.

**Result: 18/18. Fable 5 cleared every gap language on BOTH tasks.** On the hard task it now stands at
**13/13 — exactly matching Opus 5's coverage.**

| brazil-bench, all 13 languages | n | pass | mean cost | mean time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Claude Fable 5** | 21 | **1.00** | **\$10.47** | **18.2 min** |
| Claude Opus 5 | 13 | 1.00 | \$21.67 | 43.8 min |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | 15 | 0.93 | \$7.64 | 20.9 min |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | 42 | 0.57 | \$3.16 | 9.9 min |

Restricted to the **same 9 gap languages**, so the mixes are identical: Fable 5 \$12.47 / 19.3 min /
61.9 turns against Opus 5 \$25.70 / 52 min — **2.1× cheaper and 2.7× faster for an identical 1.00.**

**Languages only Opus 5 clears: NONE.**

**What this overturns.** exp-46's recommendation was "Opus 5 where nothing cheaper is proven," resting
on breadth no other model had. That justification is gone: Fable 5 is proven everywhere Opus 5 is, at
half the price and less than half the wall-clock. Opus 5's remaining distinction on this evidence is
that it is the most expensive way to obtain a result Fable 5 also obtains. **The hard-task routing
table, which selected Opus 5 for c/clojure/cpp/elixir/erlang, now selects Fable 5.**

**Method note — the failure mode this experiment was designed against.** The original comparison was not
wrong because a number was miscomputed; it was wrong because **an unrun cell reads exactly like a cell
that can't be run.** Fable 5's 4-language footprint made Opus 5 look uniquely broad, when the truth was
that nobody had asked Fable 5 the question. That is a systematic hazard for a project that adds models
incrementally, and the mitigation is the one applied here: when a headline claims uniqueness, fill the
comparison set before publishing it rather than after. The per-language matrix in optimal-blog exists
for this reason — an all-language average silently compares different language mixes.

*(Caveats kept honest: n=1 per cell, so these are coverage results, not reliability estimates — a 1.00
at n=1 is much weaker than Opus 4.8's 0.57 at n=42, and exp-47 is this repo's worked example of an n=3
result that did not survive n=5. What exp-48 establishes is that **Fable 5 can do these languages**, not
that it does them every time.)*

### exp-47 — gpt-oss-20b (OpenAI open weights): fast, uneven, not a replacement

First run of the **gpt-oss-20b** candidate (MXFP4 4-bit, ~12 GB) after its gate-probe passed —
**oMLX parses its Harmony tool calls into proper OpenAI `tool_calls`**, so unlike Laguna (arch wall)
and Devstral (unparseable Mistral format) it is fully servable AND drivable by Hermes. A lineage
probe: is a non-Qwen local model competitive? `language{python, go, typescript} × n=3` on bookshop,
ctx 131072 @ threshold 0.9, sampling matched to the 35B/80B baselines.

**Result (post-`recover`, extended to n=5) — compared with the local incumbents at their featured
config (80B = exp-38, ctx 0.9):**

| language | gpt-oss-20b (12 GB), n=5 | Qwen 80B (42 GB, n=3) | Qwen 35B (n=3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **go** | **0.80** (4/5) — mean **102 s** | 1.00 — 345 s | 1.00 — 259 s |
| **typescript** | 0.60 (3/5) — 147 s | 1.00 — 1026 s | **0.00** (fails) |
| **python** | **0.40** (2/5) — 245 s | 1.00 — 440 s | 1.00 — 126 s |

**Headline: genuinely fast, but not reliable anywhere — it does not displace the 80B.** It is **3–7×
quicker** than the flagship from a quarter the memory, and it **beats the 35B on TypeScript** (0.60 vs
0.00), a language the 35B cannot do at all. But it is **perfect at nothing**, and Python at 0.40 is
disqualifying for a default. The right description is *fast and uneven*, not *fast and Go-solid*.

**Method note — replicates killed the headline twice.** This experiment is the clearest case yet for
n≥5:

| language | after n=1 | after n=3 | **final, n=5** |
|---|---|---|---|
| go | 1.00 | 1.00 | **0.80** |
| typescript | 1.00 | 0.67 | **0.60** |
| python | 1.00 | 0.33 | **0.40** |

The first replicate swept **3/3 at req-coverage 1.0** — "a 20B matches the 80B." n=3 demolished that
for python and typescript. And **n=5 then demolished the surviving claim**: Go held 1.00 through three
replicates and was about to be published as "matches the flagship at 3.6× the speed," which is exactly
the sentence the fourth and fifth replicates falsified. A single extra replicate was the difference
between a headline capability claim and a 0.80.

**The three all-zero failures are GENUINE — verified by reproduction, not assumed.** All-zeros on local
runs is this project's signature false-failure (four published conclusions have been harness artifacts),
so `rescore` was run first — it recovered 2 of 5 failures, and the remaining 3 were then reproduced by
hand rather than trusted:
- **typescript rep3** — `tsc` errors: duplicate identifier `db`, and `db` never exported from `./db`.
- **typescript rep5** — the model appended a *second copy* of the app into `index.ts`: two
  `export default app`, plus a call to an undefined `initDb`. Its agent log ends
  `⚠️ No reply: the model returned empty content after retries`.
- **python rep2** — the model wrote a local `httpx/` package to shim `AsyncClient(app=...)`. The shim
  imports *itself* (its `sys.path` juggling cannot work — it is already in `sys.modules`), so
  collection dies with `module 'httpx' has no attribute 'AsyncClient'`. A self-inflicted import cycle.

All three left real source trees and `"succeeded": true` metadata, which is precisely why they needed
checking; the zeros are the model's, not the harness's.

**Verdict:** keep the 80B as the featured local stack. gpt-oss-20b's value is **speed and lineage
evidence** (the OpenAI open-weights family is servable and drivable locally via Harmony tool-call
parsing) rather than any language it can be trusted with. The n≥5 follow-up that was queued here has now
run — this *is* it — and it removed the Go claim rather than confirming it.

### exp-46 — Claude Opus 5: 26/26 across every language and both tasks — at 3–7x the price

Added the new frontier model across **every supported language on both tasks** (n=1):
`language{python, go, typescript, rust, clojure, java, csharp, elixir, erlang, c, cpp, objc, swift}
× {bookshop, brazil-bench}` = 26 cells, prompt=neutral, spec-gate ON. **Model id verified three ways
before spending** — a bogus id 404s (so the CLI validates), `claude-opus-5` self-reports its id and
bills, and the live agent argv carried `--model claude-opus-5` while `provenance.json` recorded it.

**bookshop (routine): 13/13 — a clean sweep**, including java, where Opus 4.8 manages only 0.83.

**brazil-bench (hard). 13/13 at req-coverage 1.0** — and after the harness fixes below, no regressions:

> ### ⚠️ CORRECTION 3 — the "first/only model to clear the hard task everywhere" headline is WITHDRAWN.
>
> This entry originally read *"Opus 5 is the first model to clear the hard task in every language
> tried"*, and the recommendation "Opus 5 only where nothing cheaper is proven" was built on it.
> **[exp-48](#exp-48--fable-5-fills-its-gaps-and-opus-5s-headline-does-not-survive-it) falsified it.**

| brazil language | Opus 4.8 | **Opus 5** | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **rust** | 0.33 | **1.0** | ← beats 4.8 |
| **java** | 0.33 | **1.0** | ← beats 4.8 |
| **clojure** | 0.45 | **1.0** | ← beats 4.8 |
| go, typescript | 1.00 | 1.0 | matches |
| csharp, elixir, erlang, c, cpp, objc | *never run* | **1.0** | new ground |
| **python** | 1.00 | **1.0** *(was a harness false-failure — see Correction 2)* | matches |

**⚠️ CORRECTION 2 — brazil/python was a HARNESS false-failure, not a regression.** Digging into the
one apparent Opus 5 loss found the opposite of a model problem: the agent produced a complete MCP
server and **all 239 of its tests pass**. The scorer reported `test_coverage=0` because the project's
`pyproject.toml` sets `addopts = "-q"`, which combines with the scorer's own `-q` to make pytest
**doubly quiet** — it prints progress dots and *no* `N passed` summary line, so the pass-rate parser
found nothing and the mechanical gate failed a green suite. (`retort diagnose` compounded this by
labelling it GENUINE: it re-runs against the *archived* tree, where the same parse fails.) **Fix:** the
plain-test fallback now uses the **exit code** as the universal signal — the same principle already
applied to the C/C++/ObjC and Swift paths — since pytest exits 5 on "no tests collected", so rc==0
genuinely means tests ran and passed. Rescored: **python → test_coverage 1.00, brazil is 12/12**.
This bug would silently zero ANY Python project that configures quiet pytest output.

**⚠️ CORRECTION (added after comparing against Fable 5).** The first version of this entry called
Opus 5 "the first model to clear the hard task broadly." That over-claimed. **On the 4 brazil languages
all three models have actually run (clojure/go/python/rust), Fable 5 beats Opus 5 on every axis:**

| brazil, like-for-like (4 langs) | n | pass | \$/run | min/run | **\$/solved** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fable 5** | 12 | **1.00** | 8.98 | 17.3 | **8.98** |
| Opus 4.8 | 31 | 0.61 | **3.21** | **10.0** | 5.24 |
| Opus 5 | 4 | 0.75 | 13.59 | 25.5 | 18.12 |

Fable 5 is 4/4 where Opus 5 is 3/4, at **half the cost per solved task and 1.5× faster** — and it passes
brazil/python, which Opus 5 genuinely fails. On the ROUTINE task the gap is wider still: Fable 5 1.00 at
**\$1.05 / 2.4 min** vs Opus 5's **\$3.15 / 10.1 min**. **Opus 5's real claim is BREADTH, not
superiority:** it is the only model with brazil data for csharp, elixir, erlang, c, cpp and objc (six
languages, all 1.00) — but those are *untested* for Fable 5 and 4.8, not beaten. **Recommendation:
Fable 5 for routine and hard work in the languages it covers; 4.8 when cost dominates; Opus 5 only where
nothing else has been proven.** Obvious follow-up: **run Fable 5 on the other 9 brazil languages** to
make the comparison fair.

**Interpretation — a trade, not domination.** The hard task has been the standing ceiling: best local
0/6, and 4.8 reliable in only 3 of the 6 languages it had run. Opus 5 clears **eleven**, including all
three 4.8-blockers and six languages no model had ever attempted on brazil. But it **genuinely fails
brazil/python**, which 4.8 passes — diagnosed GENUINE ("tests do not run / do not pass on the archived
code"), not a tooling artifact. A single averaged score would have hidden both halves of that.

**The cost/time bill is real, and it is the other half of the result.** On the routine task Opus 5 is
**2.5–6× more expensive and 3–5× slower than 4.8 for the identical 1.00 outcome** (cpp \$6.72 vs \$1.08;
c \$5.43 vs \$1.28; python \$1.84 vs \$0.50). bookshop cost ~\$40 / 2.2 h wall; brazil ~\$234 / 8.8 h wall
(mean 47 min/cell). **So: keep 4.8 (or cheaper) for routine work — Opus 5 buys nothing there but a
bigger bill. Reach for Opus 5 when the task is hard**, which is exactly where it converts failures into
passes.

**Two config artifacts caught before they became false findings** (the recurring lesson):
1. **erlang and c "crashed"** — both were `Timeout after 3603s`, i.e. the **60-min hard wall**, not
   failure. Opus 5 is 3–5× slower, and brazil cells average 47 min. Raised the wall to **120 min** and
   both then **passed at 1.0** (erlang needed 53 min, c 53 min). Publishing the raw run would have
   claimed two capability failures that don't exist. (The exp-26 lesson — *the wall was masking
   capability* — recurring one tier up.)
2. **A "usage limit until 3pm" that wasn't.** The run exhausted quota at ~02:00 and the driver parked
   until the 15:00 daily reset — but a probe at 02:50 showed the quota already back (it was a short
   rolling window). Retry cadence changed to every 20 min, recovering **~12 idle hours**.

Also fixed here: `stall_minutes` was missing from the brazil workspace (a wedged cell would have burned
the full wall ×12), and bookshop's clojure "failure" was a scorer TOOLING false-zero that rescored to
1.00/0.97 — which is why bookshop is 13/13, not 12/13.

**FINAL (all 26 cells, post-recover/reevaluate): bookshop 13/13, brazil 13/13 — a perfect sweep.**
Cost/speed per solved cell: bookshop \$2.91 / 10.1 min, brazil \$20.00 / 43.8 min.

## Historical: harness bugs & the local re-baseline saga

Three harness bugs each moved a result more than the model choice did — all **unrecorded stack
variables**. The pattern, not the individual bugs, is the finding: *suspect the harness before the
model* (now enshrined in CLAUDE.md and `retort diagnose`).

| Bug | What it did | Fixed |
|---|---|---|
| **Playpen under `/var`** | Hermes refuses to write to a "sensitive system path", so the agent couldn't create files in its own workspace. A resilient model routed around it (burning turns); a weaker one wrote nothing → **false zero**. Hit 41/48 runs in exp-27, 6/6 in exp-26. | playpens → `~/.retort/work`; `retort diagnose` returns a **HARNESS** verdict; a no-write streak aborts the run. |
| **Sampling at `temperature: 1.0`** | oMLX's default, never recorded — cost roughly **half** the reliability of every local result. `repetition_penalty > 1.0` also derails the agent loop, even at the model card's value. | exp-27 measured it; correct sampling is the default and lives in optimal-blog's forbidden settings. |
| **Context silently 128K, not 256K** | The stack-reload hook rebuilt Hermes' per-model config map on a model switch, destroying `context_length: 262144` → Hermes fell back to 128K, while the config *and* provenance still read 262144. | Never rebuild the map; `context_length` is part of the preset + the reload signature; provenance now reports the **effective** per-model value. |

**Consequence:** every Hermes-based local result **exp-17 → exp-27** is an understated *floor*, not
a measurement — the re-baseline (exp-28 onward, correct sampling + true 256K + fixed playpen)
supersedes them. The most load-bearing conclusion overturned was the **"niche-language wall"**:
"never produced buildable code" was partly the write-refusal signature — though exp-38 later
confirmed clojure/csharp/elixir *are* genuine 0.00 even on the fixed 80B stack. Instrumentation
added to catch this class of bug: per-run **peak context** (`_max_context_tokens`, local + cloud),
and a `provenance.json` recording the **effective** sampling / context / revision hash / harness
settings.

## Rejected / parked model candidates

Candidates examined and removed from the queue (fit budget: ~56 GB wired GPU → ~45 GB weight
ceiling).

- **Ornith-1.0-35B — SKIPPED (vision-optimized VLM, agent-hostile sampling).** Downloaded,
  inspected, deleted (2026-07-19). Three disqualifiers at pre-flight: (1) the MLX build is a
  **multimodal VLM** (`Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration` + `vision_config`, served via
  `mlx_vlm`) — vision + Terminal-Bench focus, not our text CRUD/MCP niche; (2) its recommended
  sampling collides with three forbidden settings (temp 1.0, repeat_penalty 1.05, min_p — stripped
  by oMLX); (3) the linked 5-bit build is deprecated (points to `-5bit-XL`). **Lesson: check
  `architectures`/`model_type` in the HF `config.json` at intake — a "tuned Qwen" can be a VLM.**
- **Agents-A1 — DEPRIORITIZED (also VLM).** Verified 2026-07-19: identical
  `Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration` + `vision_config` — **the whole Qwen3.5-35B-A3B fine-tune
  family is VLM-arch**, not text-native like our production Qwen3.6-35B. Would need the `mlx_vlm`
  text path + a tool-parse gate-probe. Revisit only if we deliberately want to test the VLM serving
  path. (Was queued as the "agent-tuned beats general" head-to-head; that hypothesis is better
  tested by exp-41 self-repair or a non-VLM candidate.)
- **Poolside Laguna XS 2.1 (33B/3B MoE) — BLOCKED (arch not in mainline serving).** Gate-probe
  2026-07-21. Text arch (`LagunaForCausalLM`, 262K ctx), MLX + GGUF builds exist (~17 GB Q4), but it
  can't be served by anything mainline: **oMLX** lacks the `laguna` arch (mlx-lm 0.31.3) *and* the
  `poolside_v1` XML tool parser; **llama.cpp** (brew build 9910 *and* master) lacks the `laguna`
  arch too — its support PRs are **unmerged** (#25165 open, #25595 closed-unmerged) with open Metal
  MoE-overflow issues. Downloaded the Q4 GGUF and confirmed `llama-server` errors `unknown model
  architecture: 'laguna'`. Testable only via an experimental llama.cpp PR-branch build or vLLM (which
  has the `poolside_v1` parser). Deprioritised: modest expected value (30B-class) vs. building from
  an unmerged PR. Revisit once laguna lands in a mainline llama.cpp release. **Revisit path found (2026-07-22):** Ollama *does* ship `laguna-xs-2.1` (its bundled llama.cpp has the arch), and Poolside's own **`pool`** agent (ACP, speaks `poolside_v1` natively) drives it via `ollama launch pool --model laguna-xs.2`. So Laguna is testable by adding `pool` as a retort agent harness (bounded work, like the gemini/omp/opencode harnesses) pointed at Ollama-served laguna — no oMLX/llama.cpp arch gap on that path.
- **Devstral Small 2 (24B) — NOW UNBLOCKABLE via the llama.cpp backend.** oMLX doesn't parse its
  Mistral `[TOOL_CALLS]` format (exp-12/23 wall). But retort now has a **`serving.backend: llamacpp`**
  path (2026-07-21), and Devstral's Mistral arch + tool template *are* in mainline llama.cpp — so it
  can now be gate-probed via `llama-server --jinja`. Requeue if the agent-tuned-coder question is
  worth re-testing on a fair stack (its exp-23 0.17 ran at temp 1.0 through the write-refusal bug).
- **Excluded — too big for 64 GB:** gpt-oss-120b (~64–65 GB, over the wired limit), GLM-4.5-Air /
  4.7-Flash (borderline), and the multi-GPU tier (MiniMax M3 428B, GLM-4.6 355B, DeepSeek-V4-Pro,
  Kimi K2.6, Qwen3-Coder-480B).

## exp-60 — does "Terra clears every language" survive the correctness gate?  — DONE 2026-08-17

**Answer: no, but the gate found more harness bugs than model defects.** 11 cells, brazil ×
`gpt-5.6-terra` @ default × every language exp-56 covered, n=1, judge opus-4.8. Final:
**4/11 pass** (c, java, rust, typescript) — against exp-56's headline of "Terra clears every
remaining language". `requirement_coverage` is 1.00 on **five** of the seven failures, which is the
result the experiment existed to produce: the checklist credits a capability that exists in the code
and cannot be reached.

| language | factual | reqcov | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| c, java, rust, typescript | 1.00 | 1.00 | pass |
| clojure, cpp, objc | 0.50 | 0.83–1.00 | **data defect** — Athletico Paranaense split across two rows |
| erlang, elixir, swift | 0.00 | 0.92–1.00 | **interface defect** — every tool declares an empty `inputSchema` |
| csharp | 0.00 | — | **harness**: transient NuGet outage, needs a re-run |

**Finding 1 — one club decides three of the failures.** clojure, cpp and objc each return 21 rows
with Athletico Paranaense split in two: 27 played / 48 pts under the accented spelling and 11 played
/ 16 pts under the unaccented one. Total matches is exactly 760 (20 clubs × 38) in every case, so
fixture deduplication is *correct* — only club-name reconciliation fails, and only for this one pair.
The same 27/11 split appeared in luna/python back in exp-57, so it is now **four implementations
across two models and four languages**. It is the hardest normalisation case in the corpus and it is
what separates a pass from a fail.

**Finding 2 — three servers are unaskable.** erlang, elixir and swift each declare
`inputSchema: {"type": "object"}` with no properties, from a single shared one-line
`tool(name, description)` helper. The logic underneath is right — erlang scores
`requirement_coverage` 1.00 and answers `head_to_head` in 8.9 ms — but no client is ever told that
`season` is a parameter, so no client can ask for 2019. This is the cleanest instance the project has
produced of *capability present, capability unreachable*. It is also what motivated the two new
response columns (`mcp_conformance`, `mcp_client_facts`).

**Finding 3 — the harness produced three false failures out of eleven cells.** All three were
separable from real defects in minutes rather than re-runs, because `_factual.json` now stores the
server's own answer beside the verdict:

- **rust** scored 0.00 mid-run on a *correct* table: nested `record` object unread, plus the probe's
  competition list lacked the accented `Brasileirão` so it fell back to season-only and got Série A
  and Série B merged. Fixed, rescored to 1.00 (`eff9f0c3`). The run was stopped and restarted for it.
- **c** scored 0.50 on a *correct* table returned as one line of prose; `splitlines()` gave one row,
  so no per-row check could count more than one Atlético. Fixed, rescored to 1.00.
- **swift** scored 0.00 on everything with "swift build failed". Its code compiles clean in 2.91 s —
  the second-chance playpen had been seeded with attempt 1's `.build`, whose ModuleCache hard-codes
  attempt 1's path. `_seed_repair_workspace` was `copytree`-ing every directory from the prior
  attempt with no filter, so **every** self-repair inherited stale build output. Fixed; swift now
  scores `test_coverage` 1.00 and fails only on facts (the same empty-schema defect as erlang).

**Comparability.** Runtime figures are post-hoc, measured serially on a quiet machine during the
final rescore, not inline — `retort rescore` had been re-measuring timing with 4 workers, which swung
one rust cold start from 264 ms to 152 ms; it is now forced to 1 worker whenever runtime is in scope.
csharp and swift should be re-run before their cells are read as capability results.

## exp-61 — does Hermes 0.20.5 change anything?  — DONE 2026-08-22, null result

**No.** Same requirement coverage, same maintainability, duration distributions that overlap almost
exactly. The 0.18.2 numbers keep their shelf life and nothing in the blogs needs an asterisk.

Every local number in the corpus (360 runs, exp-17..exp-50) was produced by Hermes v0.18.2. Upstream
moved to v0.20.5 — 24,167 commits, 161 files and +64,258 lines in the agent core alone, a **new**
`agent/verify/` subsystem, and a rewritten turn loop (`run_agent.py` +3,663, `turn_context.py` +990,
`turn_summary.py` new). The hypothesis was that a rewrite that large moves turn count and duration
before it moves coverage. It moves neither.

Only the 0.20.5 arm ran; the 0.18.2 rows are exp-49's, as designed. Agent level `hermes-0205`.

| stack | version | n | mean | **range** | turns | tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| m35 | 0.18.2 | 3 | 183 s | **99–343 s** | 12.0 | 288 K |
| m35 | 0.20.5 | 3 | 203 s | **101–356 s** | 15.7 | 553 K |
| m80 | 0.18.2 | 3 | 205 s | **137–284 s** | 24.7 | 595 K |
| m80 | 0.20.5 | 3 | 224 s | **137–300 s** | 16.7 | 491 K |

`requirement_coverage` is **1.00 on all six runs**, matching baseline exactly. Maintainability 1.00
(m35) and 0.98 (m80), also matching.

**Why this is a null and not a slowdown.** The ranges overlap nearly completely — both m80 minima are
*identically* 137 s — and turns and tokens move in **opposite directions** across the two stacks
(m35 up, m80 down). A real effect does not reverse sign between two stacks running the same task.
The within-cell spread is the story: m35 ran 101 s / 179 K, then 356 s / 1,158 K, on identical
configuration. At n=3 against that dispersion, a ~10 % mean difference is unreadable.

**Read the single replicates as a cautionary tale.** The first m80 replicate came in at 13 turns
against a 24.7 baseline and 388 K tokens against 595 K — a spectacular-looking result that was
called out as such, and that regressed to the mean the moment replicates 2 and 3 landed. Same for
m35's first replicate at "17 % faster". Neither survived.

### What the experiment was actually worth: three harness bugs

**1. Hermes ≥ 0.20 ignores the spawn cwd** and operates in `$HOME`. The first smoke run scored 0.00
on everything with no files written; the agent explained it itself — *"The current working directory
is /Users/… (your home directory), and there is no TASK.md file here."* Measured, same dir + prompt +
model, only the binary differing: 0.18.2 → `/private/tmp/cwdtest`, 0.20.5 → `$HOME`. Neither
`--in DIR` nor `--no-restore-cwd` fixes it on the `-z` oneshot path; both were tested. `TERMINAL_CWD`
does, and `_build_env` now pins it to the playpen. `_assert_inside_playpen_root` could never have
caught this: the spawn cwd is correct and the agent relocates itself afterwards.

**2. Provenance measured the wrong binary.** `_tool_versions` ran a bare `hermes --version` off PATH
while every local experiment pins an absolute `serving.hermes_bin` precisely because hermes is
usually *not* on PATH (exp-43). With two versions installed, the recorded version could describe an
install that never ran — it would have mislabelled this very experiment. Now resolves the configured
binary and records `hermes_bin` beside the version. `LocalAgentConfig.bin` was also added so an
agent *version* can be a level of the agent factor at all; `serving.hermes_bin` is one value per
stacks file and cannot distinguish two profiles sharing a harness.

**3. The provisioned `venv` was being scored as agent-authored source — the serious one.**
`SKIP_PARTS` listed `.venv` but not `venv`, which is the name retort itself uses when it provisions
a venv into each python workspace (added 2026-07-30). Run-time scoring walked
`venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages`. Recorded vs a rescore of the *same* artifacts:

```
maintainability   0.27  ->  1.00
token_efficiency  1.00  ->  0.02
code_quality      0.83  ->  0.79
```

Wrong in both directions, and **the token_efficiency 1.00 is the dangerous one** — a perfect score on
every run reads as a flawless result, not a bug. It hid because `retort rescore` was always right:
the archived run dir has no venv, only the live playpen does, so recovery silently produced different
numbers than the run itself. exp-49/50 predate the venv change and are unaffected — their recorded
maintainability reproduces exactly on rescore. Post-07-30 experiments in master.db do not show the
signature (token_efficiency 0.01–0.1, not 1.00) but have not been rescored to confirm.

A fourth, smaller one: `--dry-run` rendered a naive replicate-major order while the runner actually
groups by stack, so the preview claimed six 42 GB stack reloads for a design that performs two. The
reload key is now computed once and shared by preview and runner.

### Comparability

exp-61 uses exp-49's settings verbatim — same stacks.yaml, `context_threshold` 0.9, per-model
featured sampling, `max_turns` 200 — with one variable, the Hermes binary. `agent.verify_on_stop`
stayed **off** in both arms: 0.20.5 ships a real self-verification subsystem, but enabling it is a
capability change rather than version drift, and mixing the two produces a delta nobody can
attribute. That is exp-62.

All six exp-61 rows in master.db carry the **rescored** metrics, not the run-time ones.

## exp-mu-glm53 — GLM 5.3 + 5.3-Flash vs 5.2 (easy + brazil)  — DONE 2026-09-01

**Capability is at ceiling; the finding is economic: Flash matches glm-5.2's perfect pass rate at
~1/4 the hard-task cost and ~1/14 the easy-task cost.** All 18 completed cells across both grids —
3 models x {rest-api-crud, brazil-bench} x python x n=3, opencode 1.18.20, all models pinned to one
OpenRouter provider (z-ai fp8) — judged `requirement_coverage = 1.0` (opus-4.8). Per-cell brazil
cost: flash ~$0.20–0.85, glm-5.2 $0.84–2.59, glm-5.3 $2.59–9.63. The price of Flash is wall-clock:
2–5x slower than 5.2 (thinking overhead + ~69 tok/s at z-ai).

The grid also produced two findings the design didn't ask for:

- **The 40-min brazil wall truncated every first-pass 5.3/flash cell at exactly 2400s** while 5.2
  cleared it by 25+ minutes — the exp-62 directional confound, pre-registered and then observed.
  Raised to 90 shared by all arms; every truncated cell that later completed *passed* the gate.
- **z-ai's endpoint hangs on long agentic streams** (6 stalls on 2026-08-31 evening: request out,
  no bytes back, stall-guard kill) while short probes and its published uptime stayed at ~100%.
  With `allow_fallbacks: false` a hang has nowhere to go. Long-stream reliability is invisible to
  uptime metrics; it motivated exp-mu-glm53-provider directly. One 5.3 brazil cell took 3 retry
  passes to land — an environment loss, not a capability one.

Harness work shipped en route: `LocalAgentConfig.model_options` (the OpenRouter provider pin,
verified biconditionally — a bogus provider fails "No endpoints found", the real one serves) and
`OPENCODE_CONFIG` authoritative per-workspace config (the user's global opencode config, with a
git-sourced plugin, hung `opencode run` at init ≥120s on 1.18.15; 1.18.15 also hangs on ANY
per-model options — the pin requires ≥1.18.20). Data: experiments-local/experiment-mu-glm53-easy,
-brazil; aggregated in master-local only.

## exp-mu-glm53-provider — serving provider as a stack factor  — DONE 2026-09-01

**Provider moves duration, cost and reliability — not correctness. Parasail won everything.**
`provider {z-ai, parasail, fireworks} x glm-5.3 x brazil x python x n=3`, same opencode stack,
provider pinned per-arm via `model_options`. All 9 cells (after one retry) judged
`requirement_coverage = 1.0` — same weights produce the same passing code wherever hosted, the
harness-dimension precedent replicated at the serving layer. What differed:

| provider | mean wall | mean cost | stalls |
|---|---|---|---|
| parasail | ~36 min | $6.77 | 0 |
| fireworks | ~49 min | $8.96 | 0 |
| z-ai (first-party) | ~79 min | $8.54 | 1 (the grid's only crash) |

Parasail is 2.2x faster than the first-party endpoint at equal-or-lower billed cost with zero
hangs — its worse published 1-day uptime (94.5%) never bit, while z-ai's clean uptime hid the
long-stream hang mode. **Standing consequence: GLM work here now pins parasail** (fp8, tool-capable
for 5.3/flash; note parasail serves glm-5.2 only at fp4, so 5.2 controls stay z-ai). Caveat: n=3
per arm, one evening+morning window; fireworks' quantization is undeclared on its endpoint.
Data: experiments-local/experiment-mu-glm53-provider.

## exp-mu-glm53-thinking — what does GLM-5.3's thinking buy on brazil?  — DONE 2026-09-01

**Nothing, at 3–5x the cost: the thinking-OFF arm went 3/3 at `requirement_coverage = 1.0` in
10–17 min at $1.80–2.77/cell; the ON arm went 2/3 at 28–61 min and $5.46–10.02, and produced the
grid's only crash** (longer runs, more hang exposure). `thinking {default-on, off} x glm-5.3 x
brazil x python x n=3`, parasail-pinned (amended from z-ai pre-run, documented in the queue entry),
off = OpenRouter `reasoning: {max_tokens: 1}` — verified reasoning_tokens=0 in real opencode
step_finish usage before the grid, on both providers, with tool calls intact (`exclude: true` is
NOT an off-switch: it thinks, bills, and hides). Pre-registered ceiling caveat applies: both arms
at 1.0 means brazil cannot detect whether thinking would HELP on a harder task — this licenses
"off for tasks of this class", not "thinking is useless". Total grid spend $20.05.
Data: experiments-local/experiment-mu-glm53-thinking.

## exp-mu-primeagent — prime-agent 0.7.2 vs opencode, and the harness x language interaction  — DONE 2026-09-02

**The headline is an INTERACTION, not a main effect: which harness is cheaper depends on the
language.** Holding model (glm-5.2), task and lane fixed, prime-agent is 4.5x cheaper and 2x faster
than opencode on python — and 1.2x dearer and 2.4x slower on go. A harness ranking published from
the python cells alone would have been wrong for go. This is the first production family on the
sandbox lane (§0c), `agent {opencode, prime} x task {rest-api-crud, brazil-bench} x glm-5.2 x n=3`,
extended the same day to `language {python, go, typescript}` on the easy task.

Easy task (rest-api-crud), per-cell means over all 3 reps including failures:

| language | agent | pass | mean cost | mean wall |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| python | opencode | 3/3 | $0.113 | 177 s |
| python | prime | 3/3 | **$0.025** | **87 s** |
| go | opencode | 3/3 | **$0.052** | **170 s** |
| go | prime | 3/3 | $0.064 | 407 s |
| typescript | opencode | 2/3 | $0.151 | 113 s |
| typescript | prime | 2/3 | $0.094 | 367 s |

Correctness is language-robust for both harnesses — 16 of 18 easy cells at `requirement_coverage`
1.0 (opus-4.8), with one GENUINE miss per arm on typescript. The efficiency responses are where the
harness lives, which is the pass-proportion-vs-efficiency decomposition this project exists for.

On brazil-bench (python only): **opencode 3/3, prime 2/3** — but prime's passes cost **$0.74 each
against opencode's $2.47**, and ran faster (mean 17.8 min vs 24.1 min). Cheaper per attempt and
cheaper per pass, at a lower pass rate; whether that trade is worth taking is a budget question, not
a capability one. Total self-reported grid spend $10.40 ($1.50 easy + $8.90 brazil).

**The prime brazil failure is a GENUINE miss with an unusual tell — prime exits 0 on a run that
produced nothing.** [DIRECT] rep1 wrote no source files at all, yet `agent_exit: 0` and
`succeeded: true`; the archive holds only the task inputs. Against the passing rep2 in the same
cell it made 205 `ipython` tool calls versus 1291, and hit `"stopReason":"length"` 3 times (rep2: 0)
— the model burned the run deliberating over team-name normalization, got truncated mid-reasoning,
and prime returned cleanly. [HYPOTHESIS] `-p` print mode has no notion of "finished the task", so a
model that stalls in thought exits successfully. Two consequences worth noting: this is the exact
signature the README warns reads as a capability wall, and retort's own `no_write_abort_after: 3`
guard did not fire on a zero-write run — worth a look before the next prime grid.

**Both arms ran UNPINNED, and the provider table shows what that cost.** prime 0.7.2 cannot pass
provider routing, and pinning only the control would have made provider a hidden factor. Pulled
post-hoc from the OpenRouter activity API with the management key (per-day, per-model,
per-provider), glm-5.2 on 2026-09-02:

| provider | requests | share | billed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| digitalocean | 1042 | 70.5% | $8.21 |
| novita/fp8 | 192 | 13.0% | $0.44 |
| streamlake/fp8 | 100 | 6.8% | $0.22 |
| together | 44 | 3.0% | $0.65 |
| atlas-cloud/fp8 | 41 | 2.8% | $0.92 |
| decart/fp4 | 38 | 2.6% | $0.53 |
| parasail/fp4 | 20 | 1.4% | $0.15 |
| ambient/fp8 | 1 | 0.1% | $0.01 |
| **total** | **1478** | | **$11.12** |

Eight endpoints served one grid, **and 4.0% of requests went to fp4 endpoints** — so quantization
varied silently within and across arms. The exp-mu-glm53-provider result says provider moves
duration, cost and reliability but not correctness, which bounds the damage to the efficiency
responses; it does not eliminate it, and the split is not known to be equal across arms. **Caveat on
the table itself: these rows are per-day and account-wide**, so they cover the whole family plus any
other glm-5.2 traffic that day and cannot be attributed per-arm or per-cell. $11.12 billed against
$10.40 self-reported is a reasonable reconciliation given the retries and smokes. Known hazard,
stated pre-run and observed: unpinned routing showed ~2/12 silent hangs in local smokes; the
in-container stall watchdog plus a one-shot retry pass was the mitigation.

**TypeScript scorer false-fails persist even in-container.** 4 of 6 recorded TS failures were
TOOLING, recovered by `diagnose` + `rescore` — publishing the raw table would have reported 0/6
when the truth is 4/6. The sandbox lane does not fix this; it is the scorer, not the environment
(see the standing TS notes on node:sqlite, Bun and ESM Jest).

**Also established, and useful beyond this experiment:** prime surfaces OpenRouter **generation
IDs**, so its costs are `/generation`-reconcilable — opencode's are not. All six pre-registered
smokes passed, notably that plain `-p` has NO hidden caps (15 turns past the autonomous 12-turn
default). Harness work shipped: prime-agent as an `agent` level on both local and sandbox lanes
(ea488015), image python-v4c, and a skip-unsafe-tar-members fix on artifact extraction (eddc4de4).
