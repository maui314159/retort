"""Per-token cost estimation, for stacks whose CLI does not report a price.

WHY THIS EXISTS — the cost column has to mean ONE thing.

Retort's `cost_usd` is used to rank stacks ("cheapest model that clears your
language"), so every row must be the same kind of number. Today they are not:

* **Claude** (Max subscription) — the CLI reports `total_cost_usd`, which is the
  **list-price equivalent** of the tokens used. The subscription does not
  actually bill it. So it is already a per-token cost.
* **Local** (Hermes + oMLX) — genuinely \\$0 marginal, and recorded that way on
  purpose (`cost_override` in the reporting layer).
* **Codex** (ChatGPT subscription) — reports **no cost at all**. Left as-is it
  lands as \\$0, which is *not* a true \\$0: it is an unmeasured real cost. A
  cheapest-qualifying ranking would then pick Codex everywhere it passes, on a
  number that was never measured.

The fix is to put every metered stack on the same basis: **tokens × published
per-token rates**. That is what Claude already reports, so computing the same
thing for Codex makes the column comparable rather than coincidental.

A subscription's *marginal* cost being zero is a real and separate fact — it is
why the local stacks are ranked at \\$0 — but it is a property of the billing
arrangement, not of the stack's efficiency. List-price-per-token is what makes a
Claude row and a Codex row answerable to the same question.

PRICES GO STALE. The table below is dated and sourced; treat it as configuration,
not truth. An unknown model returns ``None`` rather than a guess — a fabricated
price is worse than a missing one, because it silently wins rankings.
