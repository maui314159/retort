    """Parse usage from ``codex exec --json``.

    VERIFIED against codex-cli 0.145.0 (2026-07-28) by running the real command
    and reading its JSONL, because the first implementation was written to a
    different, assumed shape and silently produced zeros. What it actually emits:

        {"type": "thread.started", "thread_id": "..."}
        {"type": "turn.started"}
        {"type": "item.completed", "item": {...}}
        {"type": "turn.completed", "usage": {"input_tokens": 30425,
             "cached_input_tokens": 24064, "cache_write_input_tokens": 0,
             "output_tokens": 103, "reasoning_output_tokens": 40}}

    Two things the earlier version got wrong: there is **no ``payload``
    wrapper** (``type`` is top level), and there is **no ``token_count``
    event** — usage rides on ``turn.completed``. Against real output that
    parser returned ``usage=None, turns=0``, so every Codex run would have
    recorded 0 tokens, 0 turns and \\$0 — free and effortless, and therefore the
    winner of every cheapest-qualifying ranking in the reporting layer.

    TOKEN SEMANTICS (OpenAI's, which these fields follow):
      * ``input_tokens`` INCLUDES ``cached_input_tokens``; the cached part bills
        at a ~10x lower rate. On the verification run 79% of input was cached.
      * ``output_tokens`` INCLUDES ``reasoning_output_tokens``.
    Adding either pair together double-counts — ~490% high on the probe run,
    and worse on agentic runs where cache reads dominate.

    Usage on ``turn.completed`` is cumulative for the session, so the last event
    is the run total.

    WHY this exists. Without it the agent inherits the bare host environment,
    which has three measurable consequences:

    1. **There is no ``python``.** macOS/Homebrew ship ``python3`` only. Every
       python run that reaches for ``python`` burns a turn on
       ``command not found`` and a retry — observed in the fastest recorded run
       of all three tasks, across two vendors and three models. It is charged to
       the model as agent work, and it is really a property of this machine.
    2. **Dependency installs are unpredictable.** ``pip install`` against a
       Homebrew interpreter hits ``externally-managed-environment`` and fails,
       so an agent either has to know to build a venv first (some do, some do
       not) or gives up and hand-rolls stdlib-only code. That is a difference in
       the *stack*, silently attributed to the model.
    3. **The scorer built a DIFFERENT interpreter.** ``ensure_python_env``
       reuses a venv if the agent shipped one and otherwise creates a throwaway.
       So a suite could be written against the agent's interpreter and graded on
       another one, with a different python version and a different dependency
       set. Provisioning one venv up front makes the agent and the scorer share
       it — the same interpreter writes and grades the tests.

    Best-effort: any failure returns None and the run proceeds exactly as it did
    before, because a missing venv must never be the reason a run fails.
