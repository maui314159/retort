"""Bead usage scorer.

Measures whether the agent used the beads issue tracker during a run.
Only meaningful when the ``tooling`` factor is set to ``"beads"``.
For all other tooling values the metric is not applicable and returns 1.0.

Detection strategy:
- Primary: check for a ``.beads/`` directory in the workspace (written by
  ``bd init``).  If present, count entries in ``interactions.jsonl`` as a
  proxy for bead operation volume.
- Fallback: count any non-config files in ``.beads/`` when the interactions
  log is absent.

A score of 0.0 means the agent was asked to use beads but produced zero
detectable bead activity.  A score of 1.0 means the agent performed at
least EXPECTED_MIN_OPS bead operations.
